# Logistic-classifier-for-the-MNIST-dataset
Trained a logistic classifier on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using PyTorch, experimenting with hyperparameters like learning rate and regularization to optimize performance. Evaluated the model through log-loss, accuracy metrics, and a confusion matrix visualization to assess its effectiveness in digit classification.
